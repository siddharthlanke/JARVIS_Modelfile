# JARVIS Modelfile

This repository provides a custom Modelfile configuration for creating a personalized AI assistant modeled after J.A.R.V.I.S. (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) from the Marvel universe. J.A.R.V.I.S. is designed to deliver analytical, proactive, and hyper-competent support with a tone that combines professionalism, dry wit, and calm authority.

# Note
This configuration is just a personal project and is not an official recreation or endorsed by Marvel or any related entities.
